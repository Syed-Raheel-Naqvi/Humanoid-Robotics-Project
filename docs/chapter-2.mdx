# Chapter 2: Programming Techniques for Humanoid Robots

In this chapter, we'll explore the programming paradigms and techniques required to control humanoid robots effectively. From basic movement to complex behaviors, proper programming is essential for humanoid robot functionality.

## Key Topics in This Chapter

- Motion planning algorithms
- Balance and stability control
- Walking pattern generation
- Task planning and execution
- Human-robot interaction programming

## Programming Challenges

Humanoid robots present unique programming challenges due to their complex kinematic structure and the need for balance in dynamic environments. The programming must account for multiple degrees of freedom, stability during movement, and environmental interaction.
