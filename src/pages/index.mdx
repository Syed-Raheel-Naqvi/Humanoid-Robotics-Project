# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

Welcome to the future of artificial intelligence—where digital minds meet physical bodies in the form of sophisticated humanoid robots. This comprehensive course guides you through the essential technologies that bridge AI with the physical world.

## Course Overview

The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course prepares you for the next generation of intelligent systems that operate in real environments. You'll master the integration of AI, robotics, and human interaction through four interconnected modules:

### 🤖 Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Learn to build the communication backbone that connects all robot subsystems using ROS 2. Master nodes, topics, services, and the integration of AI agents with robotic systems.

### 🌐 Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)  
Create virtual environments where robots can learn and practice safely. Explore high-fidelity simulation, sensor modeling, and the critical sim-to-real transfer process.

### 🧠 Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
Discover how specialized hardware acceleration enables real-time perception, planning, and control. Learn about Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and GPU-accelerated robotics.

### 🗣️ Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Explore the convergence of computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic action. Build systems that understand human commands and execute physical tasks.

## Learning Path

Each module builds upon the previous, creating a comprehensive understanding of Physical AI:

1. **Start with the fundamentals** in Module 1 to establish the communication infrastructure
2. **Practice in simulation** with Module 2 to develop and test robotic behaviors safely
3. **Add intelligence** through Module 3's AI and hardware acceleration techniques
4. **Enable natural interaction** with Module 4's VLA systems for human-robot collaboration

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Interest in robotics and AI concepts

## Technical Requirements

This course requires specialized hardware for optimal learning:

- **Workstation**: NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti or higher with 24GB+ VRAM
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended
- **RAM**: 64GB DDR5 (minimum 32GB)
- **CPU**: Intel Core i7 13th Gen or AMD Ryzen 9

For cloud-based alternatives, AWS g5.2xlarge instances provide sufficient computational power for simulation and training.

## Capstone Project

The course culminates in the **Autonomous Humanoid Project**, where you'll integrate all four modules to create a simulated robot that:
- Receives voice commands through natural language
- Plans navigation routes and avoids obstacles
- Identifies and manipulates objects using computer vision
- Executes tasks through coordinated robotic action

## Industry Relevance

This course aligns with current developments in:
- **Figure AI**: Industrial humanoid applications
- **Tesla Optimus**: Manufacturing robotics
- **Unitree**: Consumer and research platforms
- **Boston Dynamics**: Advanced mobility systems

Companies worldwide are investing billions in humanoid robotics, creating unprecedented career opportunities for skilled practitioners.

## About Physical AI

Physical AI represents the next evolution of artificial intelligence—systems that understand and interact with the physical world. Unlike traditional AI confined to digital spaces, Physical AI operates in real environments where physics, uncertainty, and real-time constraints shape every interaction.

Humanoid robots exemplify Physical AI at its most sophisticated, requiring seamless integration of perception, reasoning, planning, and control to navigate and manipulate the world in human-like ways.

## Why This Matters Now

We stand at the threshold of a new era where robots become true collaborators rather than mere tools. The skills you develop in this course position you at the forefront of technological innovation that will reshape industries, workplaces, and human-AI interaction for generations to come.

Join us in building the intelligent, embodied systems that will define our future.
